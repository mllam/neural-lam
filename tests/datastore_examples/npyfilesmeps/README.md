# Cropped DANRA test dataset

The `meps_example_reduced/meps_example_reduced.datastore.yaml` datastore config file in this directory points to a cropped version of the MEPS April 2022 example dataset. It was designed to be coincident in time and space with the mdp DANRA example dataset. The cropped domain is approximately 100x100 grid points centered on Copenhagen, Denmark. The time spans the first 2 weeks of April 2022.
